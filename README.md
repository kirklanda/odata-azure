# odata-azure
A project for creating a complete OData solution on Azure.  This will expose APIs via the APIM where the underlying
database is the sample AdventureWorksLT database.

The PowerShell scripts in the runbooks folder create all the infrastructure resources that are needed
for the OData API example.

An OData API is provided using the simplest ASP.Net Azure App Service Web App.
